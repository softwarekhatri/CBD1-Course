Types of Backend Architecture
1. Monolithic
2. Microservice

Monolithic -> All components inside one single project.
Limitations:
1. If one component gets affected, the rest of the components will get affected.
2. More costs would be there.
3. Upgrdaing the infra of a machine for single project is termed as vertical scaling.
4. The project becomes bulky & hard to manage.
5. Difficult to deploy / debug / testing / sharing.

Advantages:
1. Monolithic Architecture is faster than Microservice Architecture
    -> Microservice Architecture includes network calls
    -> Monolithic Architecture process all inside own system

Microservice -> Different components in Different projects.
Advantages:
1. Less code & easy to maintain
2. Easy to deploy / testing / debugging / sharing.
3. If one component gets affected, the rest of the components will work.
4. Will be Upgrdaing to the required component in Microservice Architecture.

Limitations: 
1. The timing will increase because it includes network calls.

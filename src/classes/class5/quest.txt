1) What is Data hiding?
--> It allows to manange the privacy.
---> Data hiding refers to management of privacy via using access modifiers.
---> Types of Access modifiers
    i) Public -> It allows from any package or from any class to access the value.
    ii) Private -> It allows only the same class to access the value.
    iii) Protected -> It allows only child class & the classes with in the same package to access the value.
    iv) default -> This only allows to access from within the same package.

2) What is the differences b/w Data hiding & Abstraction?

3) How to create a Immutable Custom class?
1. To make the class final -> you are not allowed to inherit or create child class
2. Hides the setter method
3. Only provide getter method

4) What is singleton class?
-> singleton class is the class which allow only one instance of the class at any point of time.

5) Where single class has been used?
-> For state management

6) What steps to create singletong class?
1. To make constructor private
2. Create a static variable with private of same class Type
3. Expose [Publicly] a static method to get the instance.
some condition -> create object if member variable is null else return the same member variable

7) Is java a object oriented programming?
--> Yes

8) Is java a fully objected oriented programming?
--> It is not fully objected programming because it supports primitives datatype. SmallTalk is the pure object oriented programming.

7) What is wrapper classes?
-> Wrapper class are the wrapper for the primitives datatypes to typecase those into the object format.
-> Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Boolean, Character

8) Autoboxing
-> When you assign the primitive value to Wrapper class.
-> Integer a = 10;
--> int b = 10; Ineger c = b;

9) Unboxing
-> When you assign the wrapper class to primitve typecase
--> int a = new Integer(100);
--> Integer b = 10; int c = b;

10) What is Java Integer cache?

11) What is the raneg for Java integer cache?
-> -128 to 127

Java Sorting Mechanism |
-----------------------
## Differences between Comparable & Comparator
1. Comparable - 
    --> It is an interface in Java
    --> It lies in java.lang package
    --> It has only one method compareTo()
    --> It is used to provide default sorting order
2. Comparator -
    --> It is also an interface in Java
    --> It lies in java.util package
    --> It has two methods
        -> 1) compare()
        -> 2) equals()
    --> It is used to provide customised sorting order

class Student{

    // to sort the student on rollNo
}

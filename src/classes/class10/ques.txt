Stream in Java
----------------
Streaming means sending the chunks of data.
Stream can be of two types:
    1. Sequential
    2. Parallel

Pipeline is nothing but to provide the stages to solve a problem / execute the steps.
Pipeline example could be : stage1 -> stage2 -> stage3
if any of the stage fails in between, then it would be start from scratch (edge case could be it could resume from where it got failed)
-----------------
Stream comes in Java 1.8 version.
Stream is applicable to all collection type.

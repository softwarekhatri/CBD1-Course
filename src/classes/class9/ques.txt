===>
Java is compiler based language or interpreter based language?
=====>
c / c++ (purely compiler based language)
1. It compiles all the source code at once
2. It create the obj file (which the native / binary code)
3. It executes the obj file
============>
Python (purely interpreter based language)
1. It will execute one statement followed by another statement
2. It will throw error if any of the line got failed
3. while failing, it would have printed out / executed the previous part / code.
===============>
Java (both - compiler (JIT - Just in time compiler) + interpreter based language)
1. Jit compiles the whole source code into byte code (middle level language)
2. It uses interpreter mechanism to execute one statement at a time from the byte code file.

JDK / JRE / JVM

Generics In Java |
-----------------
====> Generics refers to the word generic
---> To create / to handle / to develop mechanism that could work with multiple datatypes
---->
generics can be applied on only two levels:
1) Class / Interface level
2) method level

There is two ways to define generics in method level
<Y> void toReturn(Y body) {
}
public <Y> void toReturn2(Y body) {
}

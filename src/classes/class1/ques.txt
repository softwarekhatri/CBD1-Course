1) What are all the datatypes in java?
There are 8 primitives datatypes and infinite number of non-primitive datatypes are available in java.
Those 8 are:
byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

2) Can I create the array of size 0?
Yes, it is possible to create array of size 0 in java. This is valid.
This is known as empty array and can be useful where you want an array to exist but don't need to allocate any memory for elements.
The reference to the array itself still exists, but it doesn't consume memory for storing actual data because there are no elements to store.

3) Can I extend the array size?
No, this is not allowed in java. When array is created, it itself ask to define the size otherwise it is not possible to create the array.
We can create the array by initializing at the time of creation but then it picks the size of the number of elements that is passed. So, without size array
can not be created in java.
